# TVFAyushvideoSentimentalAnalysis
TextBlob class is used to find the polarity of each comment and then we find out the overall mood of the comment  section by plotting bar graph based on polarity and number of comments of that polarity. We will also try to find out the mood of the comment section using emoji analysis(bar-graph x axis-emojis,y axis-number of each emoji)
